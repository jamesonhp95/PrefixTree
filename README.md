# PrefixTree
This project has a Trie2 class which contains TrieNodes that have a TreeMap of children associated with them. 
Then, after strings have been inserted into the tree as words, there are methods for printing the prefix tree sorted, and for obtaining a list of all words prefixed by a user inputted string.
